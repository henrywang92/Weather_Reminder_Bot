Weather_Reminder_Bot is a simple python project that reminds poeple on Twitter about the current weather forecast if they tweet about going outside.

It uses the Twitter API to search and post tweets, and uses the Open Weather Map API to gather forecast data.


Dependencies:

In order to run the code, you will need API keys for both Twitter and Open Weather Map, both of which provide free access to their API's (with low use limits).

You will also need to install Python-Twitter, a wrapper for the Twitter API, along with the Requests python library. These are available at:
https://github.com/bear/python-twitter
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/ 

All other libraries used are part of the standard Python 3.0 release.
